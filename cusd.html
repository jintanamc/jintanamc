<h4><strong>CUSD </strong></h4>

<p>Our project for the semester was to design and implement a member hub. This would promote communication between members as provide a medium where current and previous members of our project team can exchange with each other.
</p>
<blockquote>Persona: Bob, an Information Science major going into his Junior year. Bob is going big and decides to apply to Apple. He thinks of something that could give him an edge over other applicants, and tries to remember the name of that CUSD member who is now working for Apple. Bob only knows that the CUSD alumni is working for Apple, but nothing else. Bob has limited options: he can try to go through the CUSD members FB page to find this person, but there’s no easy way to search for this. Bob’s only option is to try to reach out to current members to see if they remember who the alumni is? What if Bob could search this on a website, and immediately email the alumni and ask for a referral?</blockquote>

  For my first week I conducted UX research. We needed our website to be accessible so it would be used, and UI/UX can greatly contribute to how often a digital product is utilized</p>
<p>Following many of the components laid out in Materialize, I created a medium-fidelity wireframe of the website. My main roadblock was designing a filtering system that was intuitive. Luckily, many of my classes are design-centered, so I felt like I understood what I needed to know to design digital interfaces for people</p>

<p>My first iteration early in the semester: very rough</p>

<p> My second iteration 1 week later : improvements, cleaner</p>
