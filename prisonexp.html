<h4>Prisoner Express</h4>

  <p><strong>Jintana was.....</strong></p>
<p>-Gary Fine</p>


<p>I was fortunate enough to gain some relevant experience during my freshman summer at a small non-profit with a large scope. The Prisoner Express provides educational newsletters to 4000+ across 49 states in the US.

I was given the task to oversee the prisoner database. Additionally, given my interest in design and coding, I was also the given the opportunity to be the summer webmaster and ran analytics on the website. </p>
  
<p>When you are given such freedom in a workplace you also learn how to work alone. However, after several weeks of getting myself acquainted with the program, I saw there were certain areas that needed attention.</p>

<p><strong>The Problems I saw:</strong></p>
<ul><li>Lack of Funding</li>
<li>Volume of work</li>
<li>Inconsistent Web Presence</li>
</li></ul>



<p><strong>1) Lack of Funding</strong></p>
<p>I felt an urgency to help assist this organization because every single day behind the counter were stacks of , and the list of. Efficacy is key, and time is of the essence.. I read books on business</p>
</div>

<p><strong>2) Volume of work</strong></p>
<p>Every day there was a pile of letters from prisoners asking to sign up for our services. With permission and encouragement from my manager, I trained other employees on how to utilize the database and created instructional documents to streamline this process</p>


<p><strong>3) Inconsistent Web Presence</strong></p>
<p>To save time, I implemented a system that would automatically post. I anticipated this would generate traffic to the website, which would thus improve SEO  </p>
